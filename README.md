## Inspiration behind the game 

The decision to create a memory game with a Mario theme is a testament to the enduring power of nostalgia, creativity, and connection. Like many others when I was growing up he became a universally cherished character, Mario transcends the barriers of age, language, and culture, unifying us through shared memories of his adventures. By weaving this iconic figure into the fabric of a memory game, I wanted to pay homage to the joy and excitement that Mario has brought into our lives in the timeless world of Mario.

## Resources 
There are so may great YouTubers who have been such a source of inspiration and learning while studying to become a developer.
free code camp, Code with Ania Kubów, coding artist, nullX in particular were incredibly helpful with their memory game tutorials on YouTube for this project. <br>
Of course all the usual suspects were included, such as,  [Mozila Developer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and

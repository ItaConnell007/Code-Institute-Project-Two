Show back of card initially and flip on select<br>
Finished game! <br>


## Inspiration behind the game 

The decision to create a memory game with a Mario theme is a testament to the enduring power of nostalgia, creativity, and connection. Like many others when I was growing up he became a universally cherished character, Mario transcends the barriers of age, language, and culture, unifying us through shared memories of his adventures. By weaving this iconic figure into the fabric of a memory game, I wanted to pay homage to the joy and excitement that Mario has brought into our lives in the timeless world of Mario.

## Resources 
There are so may great YouTubers who have been such a source of inspiration and learning while studying to become a developer.
free code camp, Code with Ania Kub√≥w, coding artist, nullX in particular were incredibly helpful with their memory game tutorials on YouTube for this project. <br>
Of course all the usual suspects were included, such as,  [Mozila Developer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and
[w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/ ).<br>
For the images I used [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) for my icons and for my background image. 

## Design / Wireframe 
This has  been one of the more basic designs that I have created, you can't over engineer a simple card game, so I didn't do that. Instead I made sure to really understand the functionalities of the game and the code. 
Of course, I brainstormed with my mentor regarding ideas of how I wanted my project to look like. 
In the end the end, I decided I love Mario and wanted this game to be Mario themed, I wanted a functional 12 card memory game, with an alert at the end with a reset function. 
This was the image which I showed my mentor of how I wanted my game to look like. <br>

I played around with a couple of different themes, as I was looking for high quality images, I experimented with some AI images as well which was an additional educational experience in this design process, learning about AI. 


## Bugs / Testing / Google Lighthouse Testing 

While developing this memory card game, I encountered several challenges and learned a great deal in the process. One of the key issues I faced was ensuring that only two cards could be flipped at any given time. To solve this, I implemented a variable called `blockBoard` that would prevent further moves while two cards were flipped.<br>

Another issue I faced was when a card was clicked multiple times, causing unexpected behavior. To resolve this, I added a condition in the `cardFlip` function to check if the clicked card was the same as the initial card, and if so, do nothing. <br>

The most significant learning experience came from creating a function to randomize the order of the cards when the page loaded. I learned about Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFE) and how they could be used to execute functions immediately after they are defined. This allowed me to randomize the cards in a clean and efficient manner.

Throughout the project, I also gained a deeper understanding of event listeners, manipulating the DOM, and using data attributes in HTML elements. This project provided a valuable opportunity to apply and expand upon my existing knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

While working on the memory card game project, I referred to several resources that helped me understand various concepts and methods better. These resources were instrumental in solving the challenges I encountered and enhancing my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Resources, I kept note of throughout the design process. <br>
<br>
1. Document.querySelectorAll: I used this method to select all the memory cards on the page. The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) documentation provided valuable information on how to use it:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll

2. Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE): I learned about IIFE and how it can be used to execute functions immediately after they are defined. The MDN Glossary was a helpful resource:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/IIFE

3. Math.random: To generate random numbers for randomizing the order of the cards, I used the Math.random method. The MDN documentation provided useful examples and explanations:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/random

4. CSS 'order' property: I used the 'order' property to change the order of the flex items (cards). The MDN documentation provided a clear understanding of how to use this property:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/order

5. HTML data-* attributes: I used data attributes to store information on the cards. The MDN documentation offered a great guide on how to use these attributes:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Howto/Use_data_attributes

6. WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope.setTimeout: I used the setTimeout method to delay actions, such as flipping the cards back over if they don't match. The MDN documentation provided insights on how to use it effectively:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setTimeout

7. Document.getElementById: I used this method to find the win message element and change its display style. The MDN documentation was a helpful resource to learn more about it:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById

8. EventTarget.addEventListener: I used the addEventListener method to attach the cardFlip function to each memory card. The MDN documentation provided valuable information on how to use this method:
   https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/EventTarget/addEventListener

By utilizing these resources, I was able to gain a better understanding of various web development concepts and methods, ultimately leading to a successful completion of the memory card game project.

Additionally as this was a game, I had peers from the Code Institute and some friends of mine to try out the game, and offer any suggestions, ideas and feedback. 

## Acknowledgements 

I would like to thank the lovely staff, peers and my mentor Martina at the Code Institute. The help, feedback and positive reinforcement are very appreciated! ‚ù§Ô∏è

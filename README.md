## Inspiration behind the game 

The decision to create a memory game with a Mario theme is a testament to the enduring power of nostalgia, creativity, and connection. Like many others when I was growing up he became a universally cherished character, Mario transcends the barriers of age, language, and culture, unifying us through shared memories of his adventures. By weaving this iconic figure into the fabric of a memory game, I wanted to pay homage to the joy and excitement that Mario has brought into our lives in the timeless world of Mario.

There are so may great YouTubers who have been such a source of inspiration and learning while studying to become a developer.
free code camp, Code with Ania KubÃ³w, coding artist, nullX in particular were incredibly helpful with their memory game tutorials on YouTube for this project. <br>
Of course all the usual suspects were included, such as,  [Mozila Developer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and

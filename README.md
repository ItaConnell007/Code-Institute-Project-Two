## Inspiration behind the game 

The decision to create a memory game with a Mario theme is a testament to the enduring power of nostalgia, creativity, and connection. Like many others when I was growing up he became a universally cherished character, Mario transcends the barriers of age, language, and culture, unifying us through shared memories of his adventures. By weaving this iconic figure into the fabric of a memory game, I wanted to pay homage to the joy and excitement that Mario has brought into our lives in the timeless world of Mario.

## Resources 
There are so may great YouTubers who have been such a source of inspiration and learning while studying to become a developer.
free code camp, Code with Ania KubÃ³w, coding artist, nullX in particular were incredibly helpful with their memory game tutorials on YouTube for this project. <br>
Of course all the usual suspects were included, such as,  [Mozila Developer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and
[w3school](https://www.w3schools.com/ ).<br>
For the images I used [freepik](https://www.freepik.com/) for my icons and for my background image. 

## Design / Wireframe 
This has  been one of the more basic designs that I have created, you can't over engineer a simple card game, so I didn't do that. Instead I made sure to really understand the functionalities of the game and the code. 
Of course, I brainstormed with my mentor regarding ideas of how I wanted my project to look like. 
In the end the end, I decided I love Mario and wanted this game to be Mario themed, I wanted a functional 12 card memory game, with an alert at the end with a reset function. 
This was the image which I showed my mentor of how I wanted my game to look like. <br>

I played around with a couple of different themes, as I was looking for high quality images, I experimented with some AI images as well which was an additional educational experience in this design process, learning about AI.
